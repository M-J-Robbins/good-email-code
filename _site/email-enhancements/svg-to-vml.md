# SVG to VML
***Since this was first published the brilliant people over at [Style Campaing](http://stylecampaign.com/) have created an [online tool for converting SVG to VML](https://stylecampaign.com/vml/).  I played around with it and it works really well, although they do note it's not perfect as some SVG features didn't exist in VML so can't be converted. Check out the [Style Campaing VML R&D article](https://stylecampaign.com/blog/2021/07/vml-rd/) to find out more.***

From my extensive research ([this wikipedia post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language)) the SVG specification is, in part, based off the VML spec.  When comparing the two formats, there are a lot of similarities so I've written up this brief guide to help you manually convert SVG to VML.

This is not a quick or easy process but could be good if you wanted to convert your brand logo to VML so it will always show in MSO Outlook even with images turned off.  

If you're interested in SVG I also have a post about [using SVG in email](../email-enhancements/svg).

This article covers:
* [Wrapper](#wrapper) - Creating a wrapper
* [Line](#line) - Drawing a line
* [Square](#square) - Drawing a square
* [Circle](#circle) - Drawing a circle
* [Custom shape](#custom-shape) - Drawing a custom shape
* [Colour](#colour) - Adding colour to the shapes
* [Stroke](#stroke) - Adding a stroke to the shapes
* [Accessibility](#accessibility) - Accessibility considerations
* [Resources](#resources)

## Wrapper
Both formats can have an outer wrapper, however the VML wrapper is optional. If you're only inserting a single VML element you can do it without a wrapper.

**SVG**
{% highlight html %}
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1000 500" style="width:1000px;height:500px" role="img" aria-label="alt text">
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

**VML**
{% highlight html %}
<v:group xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" coordsize="1000 500" style="width:1000px;height:500px" alt="alt text">
</v:group>
{% endhighlight %}

### Xmlns
This specifies the xml namespace for a document. This is optional in both cases but for VML if it's not on the shape, then it must be added to the HTML tag  `<html xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml">`

### Viewport size
Because these are vector images, they can be scaled to any size, so we need to define the dimensions of the space we're working in. I like to think of it like the artboard size or canvas size that you would use in design software.  So if we place something 10 from the top and 10 from the left, it'll be relevant to the sizes we define here.

**SVG viewBox:** The SVG `viewbox` has 4 values min-x, min-y, width and height, for now we'll ignore the first 2 and assume they are both set to `0`.

**VML coordsize:** VML `coordsize` only has 2 values width and height, so these should match the last 2 values of the `viewbox`.

I need to read more into it but it looks like `coordorigin` may be comparable to the first 2 values for `viewbox`.

### Image size
We can set the actual size of our image with `width` and `height` in the `style` attribute.  This works the same in both formats `style="width:1000px;height:500px"`.

### Alt text
SVG has a couple of options for alt text, we can use `<title>alt text</title>` inside the `<svg>` wrapper.  Or we can use `role="img"` to define this as an image and `aria-label="alt text"` for the alt text.

VML will converted to an `<img>` when it's displayed in Outlook, so we can simply add `alt="alt text"` to the wrapper.

## Line
**SVG**
{% highlight html %}
<line x1="10" y1="20" x2="100" y2="200" stroke="#ff0000" stroke-width="2"/>
{% endhighlight %}

**VML**
{% highlight html %}
<v:line from="10,20" to="100,200" strokecolor="#ff0000" strokeweight="2pt"/>
{% endhighlight %}

### Line size
The line size and colour are done as a stroke in both SVG and VML.  SVG uses `stroke-width` VML uses `strokeweight`, with VML we need to specify a unit on the `strokeweight` so I've added `pt` however this is not a relative unit so may need adjusting if the shape size is changed.

### Line colour
The colour of the line is set as `stroke` in SVG, with VML it's expanded a little to `strokecolor`.

### Line position
SVG starts the line with `x1` and `y1` to define the start point from the left and top and ends the line with `x2` and `y2` to define the end point from the left and top.

VML combines the X and Y coordinates, so we set 2 values in `from` (X then Y) and 2 values in `to` (X then Y).


## Square
**SVG**
{% highlight html %}
<rect width="150" height="150" x="20" y="20" fill="#ff0000"/>
{% endhighlight %}

**VML**
{% highlight html %}
<v:rect width="150" height="150" style="position: absolute; left:20; top:20" fillcolor="#ff0000" stroked="f"/>
{% endhighlight %}
### Square size
Can be done with `height` and `width` attributes or in a `style` attribute.  Either way it's a direct conversion from SVG to VML.

### Square position
SVG uses the `x` and `y` attributes to position the square from the left and top.  For VML we can do this in a style attribute by setting `position: absolute` then converting `x` to `left` and `y` to `top`.

### Square rounded corners
For SVG rounded corners are added with `rx` and `ry` attributes. These can either be numbers or percentage.

For VML we need to change the elements from `<v:rect>` to `<v:roundrect>` then add an `arcsize` attribute.  The value can be a fraction or a percentage e.g `arcsize="0.2"` or `arcsize="20%"`.


## Circle
**SVG**
{% highlight html %}
<ellipse rx="90" ry="110.5" cx="251" cy="167.5" fill="#a8b3dc"/>
{% endhighlight %}

**VML**
{% highlight html %}
<v:oval style="width:180;height:221;position: absolute;left:161;top:57" fillcolor="#a8b3dc" stroked="f"/>
{% endhighlight %}

### Circle element
SVG has 2 options `<circle />` or `<ellipse />` element to draw a circle. For VML we just have `<v:oval />`.

### Circle size
SVG has special attributes for setting the size but in VML we set the `height` and `width` in `style`.

SVG `<circle />` just sets one value `r="90"` and `<ellipse />` has 2 `rx="90" ry="110.5"`

These values all set the size of the radius (measured from the centre point to the edge).
For VML we set the full height and width. So we need to multiple it by 2.

`rx="90"` ×2 = `width="180"`

`ry="110.5"` ×2 = `height="221"`


### Circle position
SVG has special attributes for setting the position but in VML we set the `top` and `left` in `style`, we also need to add `position: absolute;` here.

SVG sets the position using `cx="251" cy="167.5"`

SVG does positioning from the centre point of the circle, so again we need to do some conversion.  Subtract the width from the position and you'll get the VML position value.

`cx="251"` - `rx="90"` = `left:161`

`cy="167.5"` - `ry="110.5"` = `top:57`



## Custom shape
**SVG**
{% highlight html %}
<path d="M48 421.77 C48 250.077 453 250.076 453 421.77 V500 H48 V421.77Z" fill="#a8b3dc"/>
{% endhighlight %}

**VML**
{% highlight html %}
<v:shape path="M48 422 C48 250 453 250 453 422 L453 500 48 500 48 422 xe" fillcolor="#a8b3dc" stroked="f"/>
{% endhighlight %}

### Custom shape element
SVG uses a `path` element with the coordinates defined in a `d` attribute, and VML uses a `v:shape` element with with the coordinates defined in a `path` attribute.

### Custom shape path
The path is defined with a combination of letters and numbers.  The numbers are in pairs and give coordinates `x y` and the letters give commands to those.

VML can only use whole numbers so first we need to round these off.

* `M` **Move to**. This sets the starting point and works the same for both formats.
* `L` **Line to**. Draws a straight line between the previous set of corordinates given and all the following sets up until a new letter is used.  SVG will default to using `L` when nothing is defined but VML needs the `L` to be defined.  For example after a `C` which has 6 values, we need to add `L` to start drawing a line.
* `H` **Horazontal line**. This is a short cut used with `L` that keeps the `y` coordinate. This is only in SVG, to convert it to VML you need to look at the value of the previous corordinates. So `100 200 H150` would keep the `200` value so would become  `100 200 150 200`.
* `V` **Vertical line**. This is a short cut used with `L` that keeps the `x` coordinate. This is only in SVG, to convert it to VML you need to look at the value of the previous corordinates. So `100 200 V150` would keep the `100` value so would become  `100 200 100 150`.
* `C` **Curve**. There are 6 values, think of them as 3 pairs of `x y`. The first pair control the start of the curve, the second pair control the end of the curve and the third pair set the end point.  This is the same for both VML and SVG.
* `Z` `X` **Close path**. This closes the path by drawing a line back to the first _"Move to"_ coordinates. In SVG we use `Z` in VML we use `X`.
* `E` **End**. This is only for VML and is used to end the path.

There are a number of other commands such as arcs and quadratic curves which I'm not covering yet.  The above commands are the most common and should be enough to get you started.

## Colour
For all the above shapes we can add a fill colour. SVG uses `fill=""` VML uses `fillcolor=""` so it's pretty simple to convert. VML only supports setting colour as, 3 digit hex, 6 digit hex, colour names and rgb. So if the SVG is set any other way you will need to convert that.

If you need to set a transparent background with VML, you can use `fillcolor="none"`.

## Stroke
VML will always add a stroke by default.  SVG does not.  In the above examples I've added `stroked="f"` to remove the stroke. However if you want to use it in VML you can either leave that off or set it to `stroked="true"` then set the colour with `strokecolor="red"` and the thickness with `strokeweight="10"`.

## Accessibility
The most important thing to remember is VML is an image. So try adn treat is as such.  This includes not adding text inside the VML and if you do have to add text keep it minamal and add an `alt` attribute.

I believe Outlook will actually renders the VML as an image and displays it in an `<img>` element. So you can see it on the screen but you can't interact with it and assistive technology will just pick it up as an image.  This means any links inside the VML aren't clickable for any users. But you can add an `href` to the outermost element to make the whole object a link.

Outlook does make some attempt to create alt text based on any text inside the VML but it is far from reliable and it will add the element name which can make things confusing.  To get around this you can add an `alt` attribute to the outer element to pass alt text.
