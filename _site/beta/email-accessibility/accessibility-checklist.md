# Accessibility Checklist
Accessibility is often ignored in preference for speed.  The idea of getting something that works built and sent.  But this is missing a key point that if your code is not accessible, your code is broken.


## email wrapper
## language
## tables
Only ever as a last resort
Tables are often used to get something to work quickly, by using a familiar and predictable tool.  The goal is to not to get good enough to pass QA so it ca be sent. However when you add accessibility into your QA process things will start to get sent back.
When is it ok to use a table for layout.  What is the correct way to use a table for layout.

## headings
## alt text
## links
  * short cut menu
  * hidden text or aria-label <a href="https://example.com">Read More
    	<span style="display:inline-block;max-height: 0;overflow: hidden;mso-hide: all">about email accessibility</span>
    </a>
  * Use alt attribute on VML
## Sizes - rem and em
## Responsive, not just media queries, not just mobile
## Content order v's code order - Reverse stacking
## Visually hidden text
## Using Aria and Role attributes
These are not visual attributes so you need to consider how are they going to be maintained, how will they be translated

## Design, content and layout
I'm approaching this from a more technical point of view
