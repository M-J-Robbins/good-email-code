# VML
Vector Markup Language (or VML), is an early language used for 2D vector images backed by Microsoft. Previously it was supported in Internet Explorer but was deprecated as of IE9. IE now supports and recommends using SVG instead.  But VML lives on in other MS Office products such as Excel, Word and the one we're interested in Outlook.

For a long time I've been curious about VML and what we might be able to do with it.  MSO Outlook is by far the most restrictive email client, but what if there's some hidden treasure that means we can exploit to gain some email enhancements.
